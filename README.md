# Frenchle_Final_Copy
A website to prepare you for DELF exam! 

We have created this website from scractch and the functions include:

1. Homepage where we can understand what delf is
2. listening page where you can play the audio, and answer the MC questions, and submit to check your marks!
3. reading page where you can answer the MC questions and submit to check your marks!
4. writing page where you can read the instructions and also have reference answers. Check your grammar with the grammar checker at the bottom!
5. speaking page where you can use the audio recorder at the bottom to listen to your oral production. Download your recording as well if needed!
6. Mix test page where you can have 2 tests to practice a full on delf-like test

Users might experience lagging and some page marking function might not be very stable as of the mix test page especially.
