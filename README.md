# Frenchle - Delf Preparation Website
A website to prepare you for DELF exam! 

## Inspiration
we have created the website as high school students in Ontario often have the choice to take the DELF exams but lack available resources. 

## What it does
Functions of the website include:
1. a homepage where users are introduced to the format of DELF exams
2. A listening page with 5 available tests, where you can play the audio, answer the multiple choice questions, and submit to check your marks!
3. A reading page with 5 available tests, where you can answer the multiple choice questions and submit them to check your marks!
4. A writing page with 5 available tests, where you can read the instructions and also have reference answers. Check your grammar with the grammar checker at the bottom!
5. A speaking page with 5 available tests, where you can use the recorder at the bottom to record your speaking and listen to your oral production. Download your recording as well if needed!
6. A mixed test page where you can have 2 tests to practice a full-on delf-like test.

## How we built it
We used HTML, CSS, and Javascript to build the website. 

## Challenges we ran into
The website is challenging as it is our first time building a website using HTML. We had to do a lot of learning and bug-fixing. Additionally, it is also challenging to find the best way to present the DELF preparation steps. UI design also took a long time to be as simplistic and user-friendly as possible. The marking system was the hardest as there were a lot of issues with answers not reloading correctly or marks being counted wrong. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud to present a website that allows many high school students at our school to have available preparatory resources. We are also proud of our learning achievements with new languages. Designing a website takes a lot of effort.

## Potential Issues
Users might experience lagging and the mix test page marking functions might not be very stable.
